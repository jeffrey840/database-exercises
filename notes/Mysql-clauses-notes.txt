Where clause

✅This query will select all first names with the letter combination 'sus':
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%sus%';

✅avoid getting duplicate values:
SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%sus%';

use WHERE with BETWEEN to find specific ranges of values:
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE emp_no BETWEEN 10026 AND 10082;

WHERE with IN to query only very specific sets of values:
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name IN ('Herber', 'Dredge', 'Lipner', 'Baek');
