âœ…This query will select all first names with the letter combination 'sus':
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%sus%';

âœ…avoid getting duplicate values:
SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%sus%';

âœ…use WHERE with BETWEEN to find specific ranges of values:
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE emp_no BETWEEN 10026 AND 10082;

âœ…WHERE with IN to query only very specific sets of values:
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name IN ('Herber', 'Dredge', 'Lipner', 'Baek');

âœ…Chaining WHERE clauses:
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name IN ('Herber','Baek')
  AND emp_no < 20000;

âœ…ORDER BY clause normally follow this form:
SELECT column FROM table ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];

âœ…Chaining ORDER BY clauses:
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name DESC, first_name ASC;

âœ…a LIMIT clause follows this form:
SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT count [OFFSET count];

âœ…Adding an OFFSET tells MySQL which row to start with:
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'M%'
LIMIT 25 OFFSET 50;
