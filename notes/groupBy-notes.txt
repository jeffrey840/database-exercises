Group By

✅Using the GROUP BY clause:
SELECT column FROM table GROUP BY column_name;

✅GROUP BY returns only the unique occurrences:
SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM employees;
or
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
GROUP BY first_name;
or
SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name, first_name;

COUNT

✅how many rows were in our employees table total:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

✅only concerned about the values in a given column:
SELECT COUNT(first_name)
FROM employees
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%a%';

✅Using GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions:
        This query will output each unique first name without an 'a', as well as the number of employees with that first name:
SELECT first_name, COUNT(first_name)
FROM employees
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%a%'
GROUP BY first_name;
